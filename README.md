The Random Quote Generator is a simple web application that displays a randomly selected quote each time the user requests a new one. It is implemented in PHP and includes basic styling with CSS. The quotes are stored in a separate file named quotes.txt.

## File Structure

- `index.php`: The main PHP script that generates and displays random quotes.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet defining the visual appearance of the web page.
- `quotes.txt`: A file containing a list of quotes.

## How to Use

1. **Install PHP:** Ensure you have PHP installed on your server.
2. **Create a Quotes File:** Create a quotes.txt file with a list of quotes. Each quote should be on a new line.
3. **Update Site Header:** Open index.php in a text editor and replace the site header with your desired site name.
4. **View the Generator:** Open index.php in a web browser to view the random quote generator.

## Styles and Design

The visual style of the Random Quote Generator is defined in the style.css file. It uses a simple color scheme, a readable font, and a responsive layout for different screen sizes. The header is fixed at the top of the page, and the main quote container has a maximum width for a clean presentation.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript functionality is minimal, with a single function getNewQuote() that reloads the page when the "Get New Quote" button is clicked. This triggers the PHP script to generate and display a new random quote.
